1. Write a java program which will accept elements for an array from user. Create a separate class which will have methods to perform following operations: 
 
         •	Sort the array using selection sort. 
  
         •	Accept an element and remove that element from the array. If element is not present, then corresponding message should be displayed. 
  
         •	Accept a position and remove element from that position in the array. 
  
         •	Accept an element and create an array of all elements which are larger than the element and display all the elements 
  
         •	Accept an element and position, then insert that element in that position in the array. 
 
2) Create a class to calculate area of circle with one data member to store radius. Write following methods in the class: 
 
         •	init — to accept value of radius from user. 
  
         •	area — to calculate and return area of the circle. 
  
         •	perimeter—to calculate and return perimeter of the circle. 
  
         •	diameter — to calculate and return diameter of the circle. 
 
3) Write a program to test the below methods of String class: 

         a. lastIndexOf
   
         b. replace
   
         c. split
   
         d. isBlank
   
         e. striSailing
